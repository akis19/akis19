### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Akis, a student interested in many different things like assembling circuits, modding consoles and lurking on discord servers. I am now designing 2 PCBs that would help in SD modding Wii minis. I don't plan on learning programming languages as I find them really boring. 







### That's it.
