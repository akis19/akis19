### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Akis, a student from Greeceinterested in many different things like soldering, modding consoles and lurking on discord servers. I am now designing 2 PCBs that would help in SD modding Wii minis as well as trying to make a discord bot to help people hack their Wiis with the most up to date info at their disposal.

Some stuff that I use:
